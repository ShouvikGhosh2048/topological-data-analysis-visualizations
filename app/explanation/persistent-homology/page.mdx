# Persistent Homology

Consider the following collection of points.

<ExamplePointsSVG/>

Intuitively these points represent a shape with two holes.
However if we simply calculate β<sub>1</sub> for this simplicial complex,
we get β<sub>1</sub> = 0 (as there are no edges).

How do we formally capture the fact that the shape has two holes?

One way of capturing this notion is by constructing a **Vietoris-Rips complex**.

Given a set of points S and a non-negative real number d,
the [Vietoris Rips complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex) is the (abstract) simplicial complex C
(on S) such that a simplex T lies in C if and only if all the vertices of T are atmost d distance apart.

This means that an edge is in the complex if its length is atmost d, a triangle is in the complex
if all its edges have length at most d, and so on.

Here is the Vietoris Rips complex for d = 0.3.
<ExampleVietorisRipsSVG d={0.3}/>
(Only the dimension 0, 1 and 2 simplices are shown since we only care about β<sub>1</sub>.)

This simplicial complex captures the two holes in the shape, so we could calculate the homology of this complex
to identify the holes.

What happens for other values of d?

<ExampleDifferentVietorisRips/>

As you can see, as we increase d:
- Initially neither hole is detected.
- Then the right hole is detected.
- Then the left hole is detected.
- Then the left hole is lost.
- Then the right hole is lost.

Thus depending on the value of d, we may or may not detect the holes. How do we deal with this?

Persistent homology deals with this by considering how the homology changes with d.

## 1. Persistent Betti numbers
### 1.1. Filtrations
A filtration is a sequence of simplicial complexes F<sub>1</sub> ⊆ F<sub>2</sub> ⊆ ... ⊆ F<sub>n-1</sub> ⊆ F<sub>n</sub>.

For example, the sequence of simplicial complexes shown above for different
values of d form a filtration. 

For this section we will be considering the following example:
<ExampleFiltration/>

For each complex we can consider it's H<sub>1</sub>:
- F<sub>1</sub> - [0]
- F<sub>2</sub> - [0], [e<sub>1</sub> + e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>4</sub>]
- F<sub>3</sub> - [0], [e<sub>1</sub> + e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>4</sub>], [e<sub>1</sub> + e<sub>4</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>], [e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>]
- F<sub>4</sub> - [0], [e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>]
- F<sub>5</sub> - [0]

Notice that for F<sub>3</sub> and F<sub>4</sub>, [e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>] are different:
- For F<sub>3</sub>, [e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>] = \{e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>\}
- For F<sub>4</sub>, [e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>] = \{e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>, e<sub>1</sub> + e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>4</sub>\}

Thus we use the notation [e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3</sup> and [e<sub>2</sub> + e<sub>3</sub> + e<sub>5</sub>]<sup>4</sup> to
differentiate between these cases - we place the complex index in the superscript.

### 1.2. Inclusion maps
For a general filtration F<sub>1</sub>, ... , F<sub>n</sub>, let F<sub>i</sub> and F<sub>j</sub> be two complexes (i ≤ j) and z be a cycle in F<sub>i</sub>.

If there is a cycle z' which lies in the equivalence class [z]<sup>i</sup>, then z - z' is the boundary of some formal sum y in F<sub>i</sub>.

Then as F<sub>i</sub> ⊆ F<sub>j</sub>, y is a formal sum in F<sub>j</sub> and z and z' are cycles in F<sub>j</sub>. Thus z - z' is a boundary of y in F<sub>j</sub>. Thus z' lies in the 
equivalence class [z]<sup>j</sup> in F<sub>j</sub>.

This implies [z]<sup>i</sup> ⊆ [z]<sup>j</sup>. This also means that for any z' ∈ [z]<sup>i</sup>, z' ∈ [z]<sup>j</sup>, and so [z']<sup>j</sup> = [z]<sup>j</sup>.

Thus for any filtration, we can define the function f<sub>k</sub><sup>ij</sup>: H<sub>k</sub><sup>i</sup> → H<sub>k</sub><sup>j</sup> (superscripts represent complex index, subscripts represent dimension) which maps [z]<sup>i</sup> to [z]<sup>j</sup>.
(This is well defined as for any z' ∈ [z]<sup>i</sup>, [z']<sup>j</sup> = [z]<sup>j</sup>, and so the choice of z doesn't matter.)

We can visualize f<sub>1</sub><sup>i i+1</sup> for our example filtration by placing the classes of each complex in rows,
and drawing arrows representing the function. (I represent a cycle of edges with their indices)

(This visualization is based on this [video](https://youtu.be/l4vmErGufdY?feature=shared).)
<ExampleFiltrationPersistentFunctionTree/>

As you see above, this forms a tree. We can generalize this visualization to f<sub>k</sub><sup>i i+1</sup> for any filtration.

### 1.3. Composition of inclusion maps
Now for a filtration F<sub>1</sub>, ..., F<sub>n</sub>, consider some i < n - 1, and consider any [z]<sup>i</sup> ∈ H<sub>k</sub><sup>i</sup>.

Then f<sub>k</sub><sup>i i+2</sup> ( [z]<sup>i</sup> ) = [z]<sup>i+2</sup>.

And f<sub>k</sub><sup>i+1 i+2</sup> ( f<sub>k</sub><sup>i i+1</sup> ( [z]<sup>i</sup> ) ) = f<sub>k</sub><sup>i+1 i+2</sup> ( [z]<sup>i+1</sup> ) = [z]<sup>i+2</sup>.

Thus f<sub>k</sub><sup>i i+2</sup> = f<sub>k</sub><sup>i+1 i+2</sup> ∘ f<sub>k</sub><sup>i i+1</sup>.
As a result, f<sub>k</sub><sup>ac</sup> = f<sub>k</sub><sup>bc</sup> ∘ f<sub>k</sub><sup>ab</sup>.

This means that in the above visualization, if I wanted to calculate what f<sub>1</sub><sup>24</sup>([1234]<sup>2</sup>) is,
I can just follow the arrows from [1234]<sup>2</sup> in row F<sub>2</sub> to row F<sub>4</sub> to get [235]<sup>4</sup>.

### 1.4. Persistent Betti numbers
The **[persistent Betti number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_Betti_number) β<sub>k</sub><sup>ij</sup>**
is the value dim(img(f<sub>k</sub><sup>ij</sup>)).

Consider the equivalence classes of F<sub>2</sub> in our example. There are two - [0]<sup>2</sup> and [1234]<sup>2</sup>.
If we follow the arrows from F<sub>2</sub> to F<sub>5</sub> and track where these equivalence classes map to,
we get:
<ExampleFiltrationPersistentHomology/>
- F<sub>2</sub>: [0]<sup>2</sup>, [1234]<sup>2</sup>
- F<sub>3</sub>: [0]<sup>3</sup>, [1234]<sup>3</sup>
- F<sub>4</sub>: [0]<sup>4</sup>, [235]<sup>4</sup>
- F<sub>5</sub>: [0]<sup>5</sup> (the two equivalence classes map to the same class)

Thus the corresponding persistent Betti numbers are
β<sub>1</sub><sup>23</sup> = 1, β<sub>1</sub><sup>24</sup> = 1 and β<sub>1</sub><sup>25</sup> = 0.

In general if you consider the homology classes H<sub>k</sub><sup>i</sup> for F<sub>i</sub>, and follow them down the tree, the followed classes at each row form a vector space,
and as we go down, the vector space's dimension either decreases or remains the same. The final dimension at row F<sub>j</sub>
is the persistent Betti number β<sub>k</sub><sup>ij</sup>.

## 2. Positive and negative simplices
### 2.1. Sequences of simplices
Given a filtration F<sub>1</sub>, ..., F<sub>n</sub>, we can order all the simplices:
- We first order the simplices according to when they first appear.
- Then within each group, we order the simplices such that if s is a face of t, s appears before t in the sequence.
We call such a sequence an age filter.

For example, we could order the simplices for our example as:

v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>4</sub>, e<sub>1</sub>,
e<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>3</sub>, e<sub>4</sub>, e<sub>5</sub>, f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>

(We could have other sequences too - for example swapping e<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>3</sub> is another possible sequence.)

Now each prefix of this sequence forms a simplicial complex.
We can visualize the sequence of simplicial complexes for increasing prefixes.

<ExampleFilter/>

We have certain simplices that either produce new connected components or new holes when they are added -
like v<sub>1</sub> and e<sub>4</sub>.

We can also observe that the other simplices either merge connected components or turn cycles into boundaries (thus killing holes)-
like e<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>1</sub>.

(Note: Whether a simplex is positive or negative depends on the sequence of simplices we choose.
For a given filtration, different choices of simplex sequences can give different results.)

### 2.2. Positive and negative simplices
In general when we add a k-simplex s to a simplicial complex F, since
- dim(C<sub>k</sub>) increases by 1 when we add s,
- and by rank nullity on d<sub>k</sub>, dim(C<sub>k</sub>) = dim(B<sub>k-1</sub>) + dim(Z<sub>k</sub>),

exactly one of dim(B<sub>k-1</sub>) and dim(Z<sub>k</sub>) increases by 1.

(s is a k-simplex, so none of the other C<sub>i</sub> change, and so their corresponding kernel and image don't change.)

- If dim(B<sub>k-1</sub>) increases by 1, dim(H<sub>k-1</sub>) falls by 1.
- If dim(Z<sub>k</sub>) increases by 1, dim(H<sub>k</sub>) increases by 1.

Thus on adding s, either a hole is created or a hole is killed (only one).

Simplices which create a hole are called positive simplices.

Simplices which kill a hole are called negative simplices.

### 2.3. Positive simplices and their corresponding cycles
A positive simplex s doesn't create any new boundaries when added. It creates new cycles.

All the new cycles created on adding s will contain s as an element, since any cycle not containing s would have been present before. Thus every non-zero cycle has a positive simplex - the positive simplex that created it.

We can show every positive simplex has a cycle where it's the only positive simplex.
We do this by going through the simplex sequence:
- The first time we encounter a positive k-simplex s, it creates a new cycle. Since all other k-simplices are negative,
    s is the only positive simplex of the cycle.
- When we encounter another positive k-simplex s, choose any cycle it creates. For every positive simplex s' except s in the cycle,
    we add the cycle which has s' as the only positive simplex, thus cancelling all other positive simplices. Thus we get a cycle which has
    s as the only positive simplex.

Also if there are two cycles which have a positive simplex s as the only positive simplex, their difference is a non-zero cycle
with no positive simplices, which can't happen. **Thus every positive simplex has exactly one corresponding cycle where it's the only positive simplex.**

These cycles are linearly independent (since they differ in the positive simplex they contain).

For any simplicial complex formed by a prefix of the simplex sequence,
the cycles corresponding to the positive k-simplices in the complex form a basis of the k-cycles of the simplicial complex.

### 2.4. Negative simplices and their corresponding positive simplices
Negative simplices create new boundaries. They don't create new cycles.

Now given the sequence of simplices, we perform the following algorithm to track the birth and death of holes.
The algorithm will assign each negative simplex a positive simplex (this represents a death of a hole).

Algorithm:

Maintain lists of cycles for each dimension. These lists will track the alive holes at each step - 
at the end of a step, the homology classes of the cycles in the lists will form bases of the homology groups 
of the simplicial complex at the end of the step.

Initially the lists are empty.

Go through each simplex in the sequence.
- If s is positive, choose the cycle containing s with no other positive simplices. We add this cycle to the lists. 
This represents the new hole.
- If s is a negative k-simplex, let F<sup>1</sup> and F<sup>2</sup> be the simplicial complexes before and after adding s.
    - b = d<sub>k</sub>(s) is not a boundary in F<sup>1</sup> (if it was the boundary of a formal sum a, then s - a is a new cycle in F<sup>2</sup>,
    contradicting the fact that negative simplices don't form new cycles). Thus b becomes a boundary when s is added,
    (thus representing a hole that gets killed)
    - Since the cycles in the lists represent bases of homology groups and [b]<sup>1</sup> ≠ [0]<sup>1</sup> (not a boundary),
    [b]<sup>1</sup> can be written as a non zero sum [c<sub>1</sub>]<sup>1</sup> + ... + [c<sub>m</sub>]<sup>1</sup> for cycles c<sub>1</sub> , ... , c<sub>m</sub>
    in the lists. Then c<sub>1</sub> + ... + c<sub>m</sub> becomes a boundary when s is added.
    This will be the only non-zero linear combination of the cycles which becomes boundary, so we can identify the linear combination
    by checking which linear combination becomes a boundary.
    - For the cycles in the linear combination, consider their corresponding positive simplices, and choose the simplex which comes last in the simplex sequence.
    We assign it to s and remove the cycle from the lists.

Here is an example:

<ExamplePersistentAlgorithm/>

So the negative simplices get assigned:

e<sub>1</sub> - v<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>2</sub> - v<sub>3</sub>, e<sub>3</sub> - v<sub>4</sub>

f<sub>1</sub> - e<sub>5</sub>, f<sub>2</sub> - e<sub>4</sub>

### 2.5. Relation with Persistent Betti Numbers
We have the following important property (proven in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-002-2885-2)):

For any filtration F<sub>1</sub>, ..., F<sub>n</sub>, and any age filter of the filtration,

β<sub>k</sub><sup>ij</sup> = Number of positive k simplices in F<sub>i</sub> which
- either don't have negative simplex corresponding to it,
- or the negative simplex corresponding to it doesn't lie in F<sub>j</sub>

Then β<sub>k</sub><sup>ij-1</sup> - β<sub>k</sub><sup>ij</sup>
= Number of positive k-simplices in F<sub>i</sub> with the corresponding negative simplex first appearing in F<sub>j</sub>.

And thus c<sub>ij</sub> = (β<sub>k</sub><sup>ij-1</sup> - β<sub>k</sub><sup>ij</sup>) - (β<sub>k</sub><sup>i-1j-1</sup> - β<sub>k</sub><sup>i-1j</sup>)
= Number of positive k-simplices first appearing in F<sub>i</sub> with the corresponding negative simplex first appearing in F<sub>j</sub>.

Since this quantity depends on the persistent betti numbers, it is independent of the sequence of simplices.

### 2.6. Persistence Diagram
Generally the filtration F<sub>1</sub>, ..., F<sub>n</sub>, has a value t<sub>i</sub> associated with each F<sub>i</sub> - this t<sub>i</sub> generally represents a parameter which can varied,
and F<sub>i</sub> is "born"/"formed" at t<sub>i</sub>.

Then we can consider the multiset P obtained by taking the point (t<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>j</sub>) c<sub>ij</sub> number of times. Each (t<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>j</sub>)
represents a positive simplex born at parameter value t<sub>i</sub> which is paired with a negative simplex born at t<sub>j</sub> (they represent a birth-death pair).

This mutliset is known as the persistence diagram.

## 2.7. Persistence Diagram for Vietoris Rips complexes
Consider a set of points S. For S, we can consider Vietoris Rips complexes for different values of d.
While there are infinitely many values, we will only have finitely many complexes.

We take the sequence of these distinct complexes, and to each complex we assign the smallest value of d corresponding to it as it's birth time.

Since the persistence diagram is a set of pairs of values, we can visualize it on a graph.
For the example at the beginning of the page, we get:

<ExamplePersistenceDiagram/>

The persistence diagram has 2 points corresponding to the two holes.
