# Persistent Homology

Consider the following collection of points.

<ExamplePointsSVG/>

Intuitively these points represent a shape with two holes.
However if we simply calculate β<sub>1</sub> for this simplicial complex,
we get β<sub>1</sub> = 0 (as there are no edges).

How do we formally capture the fact that the shape has two holes?

One way of capturing this notion is by constructing a **Vietoris-Rips complex**.

Given a set of points S and a non-negative real number d,
the [Vietoris Rips complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex) is the (abstract) simplicial complex C
(on S) such that a simplex T lies in C if and only if all the vertices of T are atmost d distance apart.

This means that an edge is in the complex if its length is atmost d, a triangle is in the complex
if all its edges have length at most d, and so on.

(TODO: Add example of Rips complex)

Here is the Vietoris Rips complex for d = 0.3.
<ExampleVietorisRipsSVG d={0.3}/>
(I only show the dimension 0, 1 and 2 simplices since we only care about β<sub>1</sub>.)

This simplicial complex captures the two holes in the shape, so we could calculate the homology of this complex
to identify the holes.

What happens for other values of d?

<ExampleDifferentVietorisRips/>

As you can see, as we increase d:
- Initially neither hole is detected.
- Then the right hole is detected.
- Then the left hole is detected.
- Then the left hole is lost.
- Then the right hole is lost.

Thus depending on the value of d, we may or may not detect the holes. How do we deal with this?

Persistent homology deals with this by considering how the homology changes with d.
